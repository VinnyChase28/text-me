Fully typed back-to-front nextjs + tRPC project. The function of the app is to schedule text messages to yourself with various useful or fun reminders.

Things I want to practice and showcase for this portfolio project:

- Interacting with several different API's via text messages using Twilio as well as the React front end.
- Strong typings on both the front and backend
- Testing
- Heavy task scheduling using CRON
- Skeleton Loaders
- Dynamically changing UI
- Usage of the Twilio API for both reminders and authentication
