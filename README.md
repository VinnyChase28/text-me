Fully typed back-to-front nextjs + node project. The function of the app is to schedule text messages to yourself with various useful or fun reminders.

Things I want to practice and showcase for this portfolio project:

- Interacting with several different API's via text messages using Twilio.
- Strong typings
- Testing
